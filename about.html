      <h1>About the Site</h1>
      <p>The inspiration for my long scrolling website was the fact that for the past 3 years now, friends and family who have either visited or plan to visit the Philippines come to me for recommendations on where to go. That question in itself is still pretty broad. Even though the Philippines is a small country, there are tons of locations that one can go to that may suit their vacation preferences. However, I assumed that traveling to the Philippines, they would have to land in Manila. So naturally, I pointed them towards my home province, Bataan. I decided to design my long scrolling page as more of a quick virtual tour of my home. Unlike many, travel sites, that tell you an overview of the Philippines and the “top 10 must visit locations”, I chose to emphasize my province because just in Bataan, there are already so many places to visit. The benefit in this is that more of these locations can be visited without the least amount of time wasted just travelling to each spot. And instead of making top 10 list of locations from each corner of the Philippines, making it seem smaller, centering in on a single province allows for the tourists to see how large the country really is and make them want to discover the rest of the country and keep them coming back!
