                      <p> Mt. Samat is a national shrine that overlooks the town of Pilar in Bataan. The shrine is a mermorial for all the fallen soldiers, both Filipino and American, during World War II as they took their last stand against the Japanese forces in Bataan Peninsula. Atop the summit sits a 302 ft. tall cross that can be entered and its wings may be used as a viewing deck to see a full panoramic view.
                      </br>
                      </br>At the foot of the cross is a museum that shows records of the final battle before the fall of Bataan and the begining of the Death March. Inactive artillery surround the grounds overlooking all of Pilar along with plaques scattered around that commemorates the fallen.
                      </br>
                      </br>There are multiple spots available for photo ops to take advantage of the scenic view as well as optional attractions that everyone can go to such as Dunsulan Falls located further down the hill. Transportation can be provided unless you prefer to zipline down to the falls.

                    <p>Corregidor was the final stepping stone for the Japanese to take control of Manila Bay. As long as power remained with the Americans, they would be denied this power.</br>
                    </br> The Battle of Corregidor ended on May 6th, 1942 when President Roosevelt finally gave up the island to the Japanese. However, the island was recaptured on February 1945 by General MacArthur.</br>
                    </br>
                    Now Corregidor is open to the public but is only accessible by boat. Most locals may agree to give rides to the island but only if weather permits and the waves are calm.

                    <p>Subic Bay is a former U.S. Navy base when it was converted into the Subic Bay Freeport Zone in 1992. Subic, like many places in Bataan, is another historical site because it was so close to the volcano, Mt.Pinatubo, whose explosion was deemed to be 8 times greater than that of Mt. St. Helens. After 36 hours of chaos, locals remember Subic Bay buried in a foot of ash.</br>
                    </br>Now, Subic is a tourist's go to city. With multiple shopping malls on each block, a view of the ocean wherever you go, and the active nightlife by the water. </br>
                  </br>Travelling more in-land, one can experience the wildlife the Philippines can offer. Zoobic, just a few miles from the main city, offers close encounters with all sorts of animals such as alligators, lions, and tigers. You may even chose to opt in for a safari tour where you can make new friends and feed the tigers!

                    <h2>Sinagtala</h2>

                    <p>Looking for something fun for the whole family? Why not check out Sinagtala? It's a resort in the mountains that provides endless fun! You may chose to stay in one of twenty-four houses that house up to 20 people or simply take a day trip! </br>
                      The resort offers restaurants spread all throughout its acres and cafes for the caffeine-aholics. Hang out by the green grass that overlooks a valley under a large kubo-style canopy and have a picnic with the whole family! </br>
                      The resort can almost be a mini theme park with its giant swing that hangs over a cliff, or take a dip in the infinte pool. If you're more of a dare-devil, they also have zip-lining that brings you over a deep valley or even skybike over that same valley! I assure you, the fun is endless!
